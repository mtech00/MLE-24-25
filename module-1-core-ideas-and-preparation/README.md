1 - Downloaded Ubuntu 24.04.02 (x86/ARM).

2 - Installed it via VirtualBox on an x86 laptop.

3 - Installed Docker Desktop â€” newer versions come with Docker Compose included, so I didn't install it separately. 

ran "sudo usermod -aG docker $USER" to allow Docker usage without sudo.

4- Created a repository with folders named each module for further tasks, each containing an empty README.md .

question : If it's okay with mentor allowance, I'd like to use these virtualization tools:

WSL2 on Windows x86

multipass or VMware Fusion on Apple Silicon Mac
